Using Intel FPGA, Xilinx, and Altera to implement and upload onto boards
Also sometimes using Quartus Prime

CPU- Altera FPGA
created a 16-bit functioning CPU with all components made from previous labs coming together
this uses stack logic and incorporates real random memory.
This project was mainly done in VHDL using the altera FPGA program, tested through Vsim
and uploaded to a DE1-SOC to test the functionality of the code through a microcontroller.
After a couple of test runs and debugs worked properly.
